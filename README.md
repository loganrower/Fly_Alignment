# Fly_Alignment
This repository offers functionality that will be implemented within a Magnotether experiment in order to properly align a fruit fly with the camera display.

User is able to select points on an image or a continuously updating image (if using the ROS functionality) and a circle will be drawn based on the first three points selected. Concentric circles were then drawn based on the center point that was found.

Utilization:
* For Magnotether and any form of visual alignment of fruit flies within a simulator
* For drawing circles on any image based on points selected.
